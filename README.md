## how to run this repository locally
* start mysql
	* install mysql
	* create a database called `lbry`
	* save your connection uri somewhere handy (you will need it when you start the server)
		* the uri should be in the form `mysql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`
* start lbrynet daemon
	* install the [`lbry`](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry) daemon
	* start the `lbry` daemon

* start spee.ch
	* clone this repo
	* run `npm install`
	* to start the server, from your command line run `node speech.js` while passing three environmental variables: 
		* (1) your lbry wallet address (`LBRY_CLAIM_ADDRESS`), 
		* (2) your mysql connection uri (`MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING`), 
		* (3) the environment to run (`NODE_ENV`).
		* i.e. `LBRY_CLAIM_ADDRESS=<your wallet address here> MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING=<your connection uri here> NODE_ENV=development node speech.js`
		* e.g. `LBRY_CLAIM_ADDRESS=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING=mysql://root:XXXXXX@localhost:3306/lbry NODE_ENV=development node speech.js`
		* To run hot, use `nodemon` instead of `node`
