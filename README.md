# spee.ch
spee.ch is a single-serving site that reads and publishes images to and from the [LBRY](https://lbry.io/) blockchain.

## how to run this repository locally
* start lbry
	* install the [`lbry`](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry) daemon (0.14.2rc2 or higher)
	* start the `lbry` daemon
* start mysql
	* install mysql
	* create a database called `lbry`
	* save your connection uri somewhere handy (you will need it when you start the server)
		* the uri should be in the form `mysql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`
* clone this repo
	* customize `config/develpment.json` by replacing the value of `Database.PublishUploadPath` with a string representing the local path where you want uploaded files to be stored.
* run `npm install`
* to start the server, from your command line run `node server.js` while passing three environmental variables: your lbry wallet address (`LBRY_WALLET_ADDRESS`), your mysql connection uri (`MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING`), and the environment to run (`NODE_ENV`).
	* i.e. `LBRY_WALLET_ADDRESS=<your wallet address here> MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING=<your connection uri here> NODE_ENV=development node server.js`
	* e.g. `LBRY_WALLET_ADDRESS=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING=mysql://root:XXXXXX@localhost:3306/lbry NODE_ENV=development node server.js`
	* To run hot, use `nodemon` instead of `node`
* visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
