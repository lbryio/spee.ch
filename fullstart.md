# Create Your Own Spee.ch!

## 1. Prerequisites
### You will need the following tools installed

* Node (v8 LTS).
* Make sure you install from the **Node** website [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* npm (should come installed with Node).
* Git
* Curl
* Tmux
* Unzip

### Make sure **npm** is up-to-date.
```
$ npm update
```

### Setup a Webserver to serve **Spee.ch** from Port **3000**.
* If you are using a server provided by **lbry**, we will have **caddy** installed already.
* If you are using your own server, make sure to have a web server installed and set up to serve from port **3000**.
* Nginx instructions (recommended).
  * Insert directions for certbot before installing.
  * Install [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html).
  * Create a config file called `spee.ch` in */etc/nginx/sites-available*
  * see example: [config file](https://github.com/lbryio/spee.ch/nginx_example_config).
  * Rename all mentions of *sub.domain.com* with your subdomain name.
  * Run this command to link the sites-available. 

    `$ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/speech /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/speech`

  * Restart Nginx.
    
    `$ sudo service nginx restart`
  
  * Try visiting your website.
      * If Nginx is working, you should get a **502** error because there is nothing running on **3000** yet.
      * If you get the default Nginx greeting, you have not properly configured it to serve from port **3000**.
      * You can find logs in */var/log/nginx/* too.
  *  Caddy tutorial: [https://caddyserver.com/tutorial](https://caddyserver.com/tutorial)
### MySql

* Install MySql 
  * [Instructions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en)
* Create user **root**.
	* Note: We are going to access **mysql** as **root** for this setup, but you may want to create a separate user in the future.
  * Keep your password somewhere handy!
* Create a database called **lbry** and make sure you can use it.
	
	  `CREATE DATABASE lbry;`
  	
	  `$ USE lbry;`
	
	  `$ exit; (or press ‘ctl + d’)`

* Try logging into mysql.
	
	  `$ mysql -u username -p`
		
* If you are using a **LBRY** server, your **password** is the one provided for **ssh**.
  * Note: If it fails, try using `sudo`.

##2.  Install & Run the LBRY Daemon

### Install **lbrynet** 
_note: if you have a server from LBRY, lbrynet is already installed, you can skip to 2.4._
```
$ wget --quiet -O ~/latest_daemon.zip https://lbry.io/get/lbrynet.linux.zip
$ unzip -o -u "~/latest_daemon.zip"
```
### Start lbrynet
```
$ tmux
$ ./lbrynet-daemon
```

### Detach (exit) the tmux session and leave **lbrynet** running in the background.
	
press `ctrl` + `b` then `d` to detach
	
### Get LBC!

Get a list of your wallets:

```
$ ~/lbrynet-cli wallet_list
```

Send some LBC to one of the addresses from your wallet.

Check your balance again:

```
$ ~/lbrynet-cli wallet_balance
```
	
You should have **LBC**!

### Install ffmpeg
